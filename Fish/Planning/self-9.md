## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 9

You must make an appointment with your grader during his or her office
hour to demo your project. See the end of the self-eval for the assigned
grader. 

Indicate below where your TA can find the following elements in your strategy 
and/or player-interface modules: 

2. for game observers, point the TA to
   - the `game-observer` interface that observers implement
      https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/tenaha/blob/1ebb990a9e725449d5a7f5f08431aaf147c32427/Fish/Admin/src/referee/referee.ts#L49-L59
      
   - the point where the `referee` consumes observers
      https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/tenaha/blob/1ebb990a9e725449d5a7f5f08431aaf147c32427/Fish/Admin/src/referee/referee.ts#L155-L161
      
   - the callback from `referee` to observers concerning turns
      https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/tenaha/blob/1ebb990a9e725449d5a7f5f08431aaf147c32427/Fish/Admin/src/referee/referee.ts#L299-L315
      

Do not forget to meet the assigned TA for a demo; see bottom.  If the
TA's office hour overlaps with other obligations, sign up for a 1-1.
