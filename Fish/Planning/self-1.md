## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?
      - Yes, see the line on `HackerInterface` in `system.pdf`



  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games
      - Yes, see the line on `referee` on the Server side in `system.pdf`



  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components
      - No, we did not have this



- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
    - Yes, this is done by Step 3 in `milestones.pdf`




  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 
    - No, we did not have a milestone for this




  - for running remote tournaments on a network
    - Yes, this is done by Step 5 in `milestones.pdf`





- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?
      - Yes, each paragraph describes the details of a single milestone or component.




  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?
    - The sentences are short and do not have any fluff words.




  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?
      - No, our memo was in a bullet format.




  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?
      - Headers were not full sentences, but the descriptions for each component/milestone were well formed sentences.



  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)
      - Yes, we checked our spelling, and it is correct.



The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
