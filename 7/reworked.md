feedback: GameNode interpretation doesn't seem to talk about skip: how does the user know what kind of node it represents? (-10 for skip) (skip comment is not enough, your interpretation should talk about it)

approach to fix: Talked through the data definition. Had a debate what a game tree should conceptualize. Added the result to the data definition

feedback: choosing turn action: purpose statement and/or data definition/interpretation of <Action> don't explain what the result means

approach: further clarify the data definition of an action. Express what it represents. More explanation of what a result means

feedback: insufficient interpretation of the board (it should be clear what all components of the data definition mean, how the data definition represents a real game board - example definition, tiles/holes). Please revise the interpretation to be as exact as possible, instead of saying the third model, it would be more clear to mention the name of the coordinate system on the website linked.

approach: talked through the data definition and what each component of a board represents
