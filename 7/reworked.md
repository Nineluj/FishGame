feedback: GameNode interpretation doesn't seem to talk about skip: how does the user know what kind of node it represents? (-10 for skip) (skip comment is not enough, your interpretation should talk about it)

approach to fix: Talked through the data definition. Had a debate what a game tree should conceptualize. Added the result to the data definition
